The programs here are used to generate the results in "1 Points = 1 Points?" by George Waters.  The *.csv file is a sample of the game data used for the NBA stats results.  Complete data files are available from bigdataball.com.

To generate results, the "combined-stats.csv" should be changed to "combined-stats-4-games.csv".  In R, the directory must be set to the location of the data file.

The Sim files are used to generate histograms and critical values using simulated data.

The det var files include an estimated trend to represent the expected outcome.

The det var spread files use pre-game spreads to determine the trend.
